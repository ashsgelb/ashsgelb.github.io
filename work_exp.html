									<h3 class="major">Wells Fargo — Engineering Intern Analyst</h3>
                                    <p>Jun. 2024 - Aug. 2024</p>
                                    <p>During my internship within the Technology, Cybersecurity, and Control Management group, I developed and maintained an automated tool designed to detect anomalies across networks, hosts, services, and applications. This project significantly enhanced security measures by identifying potential data leaks and vulnerabilities. I collaborated with a full stack team, contributing to front-end, back-end, and database development, while applying DevOps practices and agile methodologies to improve project efficiency. Additionally, I assisted in maintaining and documenting an API for efficient data retrieval and contributed to test automation frameworks aimed at enhancing application security and reliability.</p>
                                    <p><b>Skills: </b> Cybersecurity, network discovery, anomaly detection, full stack development, DevOps, agile methodology, API development and usage. </p>

                                    <p>Mar. 2023 - Curr.</p>
                                    <p>In my role at the Office of the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at the University of Michigan, I took the initiative to develop custom software solutions that optimized office tasks and enhanced workflow. I wrote Python scripts to automate various processes, including converting Excel text to lowercase while preserving exceptions. Additionally, I created a web-based inventory system to track office supplies, such as snacks and drinks, and developed a program to parse conference agendas, categorize entries, and generate organized outputs. Leveraging AI, I streamlined tasks like drafting executive bios and improving overall workflow efficiency. This experience allowed me to showcase my creativity and problem-solving skills while enhancing productivity in the office.</p>
